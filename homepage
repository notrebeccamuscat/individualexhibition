      <h2>What is design theory?</h2>
      <p>
        Design theory is a system for helping graphic designers better
        understand how to communicate messages to audiences through visuals. It
        involves identifying elements in an image and explaining why they are
        important. Design theory can help designers make aesthetic decisions and
        ensure that their work communicates the intended message to viewers.<br /><br />Graphic
        designers often employ design theory when creating images for marketing
        purposes, such as advertisements or brand logos.

    <div class="why">
      <!-- Second section of info -->
      <h2>Why is design theory important?</h2>
      <p>
        Design theory is integral to graphic design as it helps designers craft
        thoughtful and clear messages to viewers. For instance, if one wanted to
        highlight the importance of education, they could create a visual
        featuring children sitting at desks and interacting positively with
        their teacher. Incorporating design theory into advertisements and
        logos, for example, can help them grab viewers' attention and establish
        an emotional connection.

        <h2>The Principles of Design Theory</h2>
        <p>
          There are five principles of design theory that individuals may use
          when beginning a new project. While each principle offers individual
          support to a project, it's important to have all five principles so
          that they can combine to communicate a clear and meaningful message to
          viewers.

          <h3>👉 Alignment 👈</h3>
          <p>
            Graphic designers use alignment to ensure that their visuals match
            the message they want to communicate with viewers.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>👉 Repetition 👈</h3>
          <p>
            Repetition involves introducing elements of design that repeat
            throughout an image.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>👉 Contrast 👈</h3>
          <p>
            Contrast takes place when a graphic designer uses two opposing
            design styles or materials and combines them in one image.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>👉 Hierarchy 👈</h3>
          <p>
            Hierarchy involves placing items in an image close together to imply
            that the items relate to each other.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>👉 Balance 👈</h3>
          <p>
            Graphic designers use balance to create tension or peace in an
            image, which affects how a viewer reacts to it.
